# future enhancements for my nvim setup

```
- create an autocommand which will automatically apply spacing when typing a variable which needs an =, but only for certain languages, for example:
   - fruit = "apple" // notice the space before and after the = sign are automatically added
   - maybe even make it add a , too

- fix autocompletion and fix performance

- maybe we can incorporate smooth scrrolling, typing?

- maybe we can make the cursor blink, and incorporate smooth cursor movement?
